# CSIT321_Group17_EasyShop

Our product can help people compare prices of items they want to buy and track related product information to help people make decisions easier. Before starting the project, it is required to install Uniapp, Hbuilder, node.js and mysql in your computer and configure its related environment. Because of copyright issues, the project does not support the shelves of the store with others to use commercially, if any infringement will be prosecuted. Also the project is not deployed to a server and is only allowed to run locally and debug on mobile.

Similarly, in this program, because of the inability to work with commercial companies such as Amazon, ebay, etc., the product needs to use a crawler to get the data, which will not be published in order to ensure the security of the copyright and will only be shown in the demo.

1. double-click to start the crawler program
2. Find the server file in your project, go to it, right click to open command type "npm start"
3. Open HbuilderX, import the project and run it on your browser or phone

  The app can be viewed under that site: http://127.0.0.1:8080/#/
